    <h3><u>Why I Chose This Topic</u></h3>
    <p>The topic options given were food, video games, movies, or places I have visited.<br>
    I couldn't think of a lot of movies, and I haven't traveled many places.<br>
    I feel that if I share my favorite video games, I won't beat the "not a gamer" allegations.<br>
    I felt listing my favorite foods was the safest option. It might be obvious, but I have a sweet tooth.<br>
    Sweets aren't the only thing I like, though. New York Pizza is the best, no contest.
