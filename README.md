## How authentication works:
- When the user opens the webpage, the function checkCredentials is called to see if the user is logged in.
- If not, the webpage displays only the list, Login button, and Register button.
- If the user is logged in, the webpage displays an update and delete button below every item in the list, as well as an Add to List button and Logout button.
